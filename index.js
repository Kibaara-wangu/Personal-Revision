// Write a JavaScript expression using the modulus operator to find the remainder when 15 is divided by 4.
let x = 15;
let y = 4;
let modulus = x % 4;
console.log(modulus);


// What is the difference between the "==" and "===" operators in JavaScript? Provide an example.
// "==" represent looselyEqualTo in Javascript. It only cheecks for the value.
// "===" represents strictlyEqualTo. It checks for both values and datatypes.
let m = "4";
let looselyEqualTo = y == m;
console.log(looselyEqualTo);

let strictlyEqualTo = y ===m;
console.log(strictlyEqualTo);

// Write a JavaScript expression to concatenate two strings.
let j = "my";
let k = "valentine";
let identity = j +" "+k;
console.log(identity);



// Explain the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript.
// undefined means that a variable has already been declared but hasn't been assigned a value while Null means that a variable has been declared a value by null.

// Create an array in JavaScript and demonstrate how to access the third element.
const fruits = ["orange", "pineapple", "mango"];
let fruit = fruits[2];


//Calculate the result of 8 divided by 3 using both regular division and floor division in Python.
e = 12;
p = 4;
division = e / p
print(division)

e= 12
p=5
print(12//5)


// Explain the use of the in operator in Python with a practical example
// It is used to check if a value exist within a string
"r" in "flower" 
// output s = 11

// Write a Python expression to find the product of two numbers.
q = 8
m = 3
d = q * m

// Declare a variable in Python and assign it the value of a floating-point number. Determine its data type using the type() function.
i= 35.3
typeof(i)




// What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python? Provide an example of each.
// Turples are immutable meaning they can't be reassigned a value ones assigned while lite is mutable meaning you can assighn another value to it.
// List are a group of comma seperated values within a square brackets while turple is a group of separated value within parenthesis
eg m[20,4,12,34]
k(12,48,54)

// Create a dictionary in Python representing a person with keys for "name," "age," and "city."
// thisdict = dict(name="mercy", age=26, city="Nairobi")
// print(thisdict)
